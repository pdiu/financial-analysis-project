# financial-analysis-project

This repository contains code for a personal project where I am:
  -calling a finance API - AlphaVantage
  -getting data about companies/tickers/symbols of personal interest
  -mapping the data from json -> pandas dataframes -> csv
  -performing data analysis on the csv files to find insights into the companies and utilizing my economics knowledge to get the most out of the data
 
 And hopefully in the near future:
  -Create plots using matplotlib, seaborn or other libraries
  -Use statistical learning methods to generate even more valuable insights
  -Perform machine learning on new companies/tickers/symbols i'm interested in to determine whether or not a company is worth investing in
